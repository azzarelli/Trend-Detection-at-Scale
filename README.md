# Generalised Univariate Trend Detection at Scale
MEng 4th year Group Design Project

## Breif
Over the course of 12-weeks our team researched, designed and implemented three novel techniques for trend-dection based heavily on existing research.

Generalised univatiated trend detection is a research niche dominated by several legacy methods (e.g. Mann-Kendal Test and Theil-Sen Approach), thus 
designing new methods for trend detection relied heavily on research into similar domains where knowledge was transferable - such as univariate change-point
detection which was used to optimise performance at scale (we found reductions in total computation of ~30% whilst maintaining similar detection rates to classical approaches). The resulting designs vary from variance based detection methods to lunsupervised learning approaches to mapping features of trends at scale.
